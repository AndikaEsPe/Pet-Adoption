## Project Summary:
The objective of this project is to create a model for the administration and upkeep of a pet adoption shelter organization with multiple branches. It aims to facilitate the manipulation and maintenance of databases related to the pet adoption process, as well as the logistical aspects of shelters, encompassing the registration and record-keeping of adopters, sponsors, events, employees, volunteers, foster families, and more.

***What has been achieved through this project?***  

This project enables the shelter organization's manager to oversee the entire operational status of its branches. This includes accessing critical information such as the status of pet adoptions, fostering activities, branches with rescued pets within a specific age range (for event decision-making), and event records, etc. Additionally, the project enables the shelter to efficiently manage and maintain its operations by allowing for the addition, registration, deletion, update, and selection of information within the databases related to rescued pets, adopters, foster families, sponsors, and other pertinent details.
